* This assignment outlines differential equations involved with modeling an undamped spring-mass model, an overdamped spring-mass model and an underdamped spring-mass model.       Additionally, it covers the process of plotting all of these differential equations using matplotlib in python.
  
### 1.1.4 A Predator-Prey System

* This assignment outlines differential equations involved with modeling a predator prey system with a hare population and a lynx population. In this example, the equations which model the two populations are dependent on eachother and form a non-linear system of differential equations.  Additionally, this assignment covers the process of plotting this system of differential equations using matplotlib in python.
